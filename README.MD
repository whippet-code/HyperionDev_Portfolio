### Build Updates
Task 42 - Update build - 27 Jan 23

Added like & save function to portfolio page. Accessed via clicking on portfolio items on home page.
Items stored to session storage arrays, saved page build from the saved array. Navigating back to portfolio page will keep the state of the saved projects (so the icon will remain highlighted as saved) (Not implemented on liked as not a task requirment but follows same technique)

Contact page & comments section to saved page added with confirmation of submit.

Restyled site, and polished up a couple of other bits.

## Section 4
### Coming Updates
TODO - Folder/structure tidy. Liked projects store/rebuild. CV link
